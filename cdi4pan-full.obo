comment: Definition n============ nUnit of thought differentiated by characteristics (from the Generic Statistical Information Model version 1.2: https://statswiki.unece.org/display/clickablegsim/Concept).  nnExamples n========== nVelocity, Distance, Poverty, Income, Household Relationship, Family, Gender, Business Establishment, Satisfaction, Mass, Air Quality, etc.nnnExplanatory notes n=================== nMany DDI-CDI classes are subtypes of the concept class including category, universe, unit type, conceptual variable.

comment: Definition n============ nA variable at the highest level of abstraction.n  nExamples n========== nA gender variable defining two categories – "male" and "female" allowing relating each of these to concepts having description of how these categories are decided.nnExplanatory notes n=================== nThe conceptual variable allows for describing the domain of concepts it can take on as well as the type of unit that can be measured. A conceptual variable for blood pressure might, for example describe the conditions under which the pressure is to be taken (sitting as opposed to standing) and a conceptual value domain as height of mercury – without units. One represented variable would further refine this by specifying inches as the unit of measurement for the height. Another might specify that the height be represented in centimeters. Both represented variables could reference the same conceptual variable to indicate in what way they are comparable.

Number of employees: Microsoft has 90,000 employees; IBM has 433,000 employees, etc.n3.

Two instance variables of a person's height reference the same represented variable. This indicates that they are intended to: be measured with the same unit of measurement, have the same intended data type, have the same substantive value domain, use a sentinel value domain drawn from the same set of sentinel value domains, have the same sentinel (missing value) concepts, and draw their population from the same universe. In other words, the two instance variables should be comparable.nnExplanatory notesn================= nThe instance variable class inherits all of the properties and relationships of the represented variable class and, in turn, the conceptual variable class. This means that an instance variable can be completely populated without the need to create an associated represented variable or conceptual variable. If, however, a user wishes to indicate that a particular instance variable is patterned after a particular represented variable or a particular conceptual variable that may be indicated by including a relationship to the represented variable and/or conceptual variable. Including these references is an important method of indicating that multiple instance variables have the same representation, measure the same concept, and are drawn from the same universe. If two instance variables of a person's height reference the same represented variable. This indicates that they are intended to: be measured with the same unit of measurement, have the same intended data type, have the same substantive value domain, use a sentinel value domain drawn from the same set of sentinel value domains, have the same sentinel (missing value) concepts, and draw their population from the same universe. In other words, the two instance variables should be comparable. The instance variable describes actual instances of data that have been collected.

comment: Definition n========== nConceptual variable with a substantive value domain specified.   nnExamples n========== nThe pair (Number of Employees, Integer), where "Number of Employees" is the characteristic of the population (variable) and "Integer" is how that measure will be represented (value domain).  nnExplanatory notes n=================== nExtends from conceptual variable and can contain all descriptive fields without creating a conceptual variable. By referencing a conceptual variable it can indicate a common relationship with represented variables expressing the same characteristic of a universe measured in another way, such as Age of Persons in hours rather than years. Represented variable constrains the coverage of the unit type to a specific universe. In the above case the universe with the measurement of Age in hours may be constrained to Persons under 5 days (120 hours old). Represented variable can define sentinel values for multiple storage systems which have the same conceptual domain but specialized value domains.

comment: Definitionn==========nIndividual object of interest for some statistical activity, such as data collection.nnExamplesn========nHere are 3 examples:nn1. Individual US person (i.e., Arofan Gregory, Dan Gillman, Barack Obama, etc.)n2. Individual US computer companies (i.e., Microsoft, Apple, IBM, etc.)n3. Individual US universities (i.e., Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland, Yale, etc.) [GSIM 1.1]nnExplanatory notesn=================nIn a traditional data table each column might represent some variable (measurement). Each row would represent the entity (Unit)  to which those variables relate. Height measurements might be made on persons (unit type) of primary school age (Universe) at Pinckney Elementary School on September 1, 2005 (population). The height for Mary Roe (Unit)  might be 139 cm.nnThe Unit is not invariably tied to some value. A median income might be calculated for a block in the U.S. but then used as an attribute of a person residing on that block. For the initial measurement the Unit was the block. In the reuse the unit would be that specific person to which the value was applied.nnIn a big data table each row represents a unit/variable double. Together a unit identifier and a variable identifier define the key. And for each key there is just one value – the measure of the unit on the variable.nnA big data table is sometimes referred to as a column-oriented data store whereas a traditional database is sometimes referred to as a row-oriented data store. The unit plays an identifier role in both types of data stores.

name: UnitType
comment: Definitionn==========nUnit type is a type or class of objects of interest (units).nnExamplesn========nPerson, Establishment, Household, State, Country, Dog, Automobile, Neutrino.nnExplanatory notesn=================nUnit type is the most general in the hierarchy of unit type, universe, and population. It is a description of the basic characteristics for a general set of Units. A universe is a set of entities defined by a specialization of a unit type. A Population further narrows the specification to a specific time and geography.nnA unit type is used to describe a class or group of Units based on a single characteristic with no specification of time and geography. For example, the unit type of "Person" groups together a set of Units based on the characteristic that they are "Persons".nnIt concerns not only unit types used in dissemination, but anywhere in the statistical process. E.g. using administrative data might involve the use of a fiscal unit. [GSIM 1.1].
